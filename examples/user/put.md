# Update Current User

Allow the Authenticated User to update their details.

- **üåè URL**: `/api/user/`
- **üõ§Ô∏è Method**: `PUT`
- **üîê Auth required**: `YES`
- **üö´ Permissions required**: None

## üì§ Request
- **üìã Header constraints**
  - UAPP: `1 to 8 chars`
    > The application used to update the User's information can be sent in the header. Values passed in the `UAPP` header only pass basic checks for validity:
    > -  If 0 characters, or not provided, ignore.
    > - If 1 to 8 characters, save.
    > - If longer than 8 characters, ignore.
- **üìã Data constraints**
  - first_name: `1 to 30 chars`
  - last_name: `1 to 30 chars`
    > Note that `id` and `email` are currently read only fields.
- **‚úâ Data examples**
  > Partial data is allowed.
  - **Just first name**
    ```json
    {
      "first_name": "John"
    }
    ```
  - Empty data can be PUT to erase the name, in this case from the iOS application version 1.2:
    
    `UAPP: ios1_2`  
    ```json
    {
      "last_name": ""
    }
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Endpoint will ignore irrelevant and read-only data such as parameters that don't exist, or fields that are not editable like `id` or `email`.
- Similar to the `GET` endpoint for the User, if the User does not have a UserInfo instance, then one will be created for them.
