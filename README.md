# REST API Documentation Templates

## ðŸ…¾ In Markdown

This repository forked from [restapidocs](https://github.com/jamescooke/restapidocs) that created by [jamescooke](https://github.com/jamescooke).

The author of the repository inspired by [@iros](https://github.com/iros)'s [documentation gist](https://gist.github.com/iros/3426278).

Focus on using the templating Markdown to create comprehensive, structured and helpful API documentation. Structure should be regular and repeated across endpoints and between projects.

## ðŸ¤¨ What's the difference with this forked one?
This forked template was improved by using a tree list and also added emoji for easy viewing of the details or attributes of the endpoint API. The requests and responses are grouped in each perspective. The responses were also grouped by the error and success responses.

In a brief way, here is what's makes this endpoint API template different from the original one:
- Use the tree list and emojis to view the details and attributes.
- grouped the requests and responses
- grouped the error and success responses.
